gradle-jenkins-plugin
=====================

Gradle plugin to programmatically configure Jenkins jobs.  This plugin allows you to maintain jenkins job configurations in source control and apply them to the server via gradle.  Jobs can be stored as straight xml files, xml strings, markup builder closures, or jenkins job dsl.  Job templates can be defined that can then be manipulated such that multiple jobs can be generated off of a single template definition.

See https://github.com/ghale/gradle-jenkins-plugin/wiki for details on usage.

_**I'm currently looking for someone to take over maintenance of this project.  Over the years, this plugin has had a healthy user base and when I was working with Jenkins on a daily basis, I was highly motivated to improve this plugin and keep it up to date.  Thank you to everyone who has contributed and been involved!**_  

_**Unfortunately, I no longer work with Jenkins on a frequent basis and I've had difficulty finding the time in recent years to maintain this plugin. This has resulted in low activity and a lack of responsiveness to issues on my part.  I would welcome someone who is motivated to invest the time it deserves and make this project thrive.  If you're interested, please contact me at: gary at gradle dot com.**_
